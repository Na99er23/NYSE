Here we use MS Excel to analyse and build a dashboard for the dataset of S&P 500. This project consisted of three tasks;
Explore a general look on the data and calculate some qualitative stats to be presented on ppt slides. 
Secondly, We build a Profit and Loss statement for all S&P 500.
Laslty, We create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios; Best case, Base case, and Worst case.
There's no need to install anything here, a valid MS Excel will be just fine.
